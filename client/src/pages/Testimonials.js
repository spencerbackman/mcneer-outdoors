                    It’s our favorite “room”. The favorite "room" at our house is the backyard. Since Phil installed his mosquito misting system along the perimeter of our yard four years ago, we have been able to enjoy our outdoor time without the hassle of pesky mosquitoes until way past dusk. The system has really proven its worth! It also helps keep buffalo gnats at bay! We highly recommend Phil McNeer’s services.

                    Mosquitoes in Mississippi are certainly a nuisance, but they can also carry the West Nile Virus. The MistAway insect control system I purchased from ProfessionalLawn Care makes life around my pool much more enjoyable while also helping to protect my family’s health. And that’s important to me. The technicians were very professional, installation was completed in one day, and the system only has to put out two to three short mists per day to achieve amazing insect control. I highly recommend Phil McNeer and the MistAway insect control system.

                    I loved working with Phil, and I’m really pleased with what he did. He’s done our mosquito system, our drainage system, and our sprinkler system. We had a brand new house, and we tried to find someone to do the landscaping. Other services said it would take a couple of months to get to us, but Professional Lawn Care came right away. I felt like it was a bad time to plant, but now everything has been sodded. We’ve lived in the house for six weeks, and it looks like we’ve been here for several months. We are very, very pleased.

                    He’s done several of our facilities and jobs around Ruleville, so we knew Phil would be professional and do a great job. He did the original landscaping at the hospital, including an irrigation system. As we have continued to grow, he has continued to add to our landscaping areas. They weed and cut the grass as needed. And each season he replaces the plants that need to be replaced. They do a wonderful job.
